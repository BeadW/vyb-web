# Research: Visual AI Collaboration Canvas

## Overview
Research decisions and technical analysis for implementing a multi-platform visual AI collaboration system for social media post creation with gesture-based navigation and device simulation.

## Key Research Areas

### 1. Multi-Platform Canvas Implementation

**Decision**: Platform-specific canvas with shared state management
- Web: HTML5 Canvas API with Fabric.js for object manipulation
- iOS: Core Graphics with UIKit custom views for complex interactions
- Android: Custom Canvas with Jetpack Compose integration

**Rationale**: Each platform has optimized canvas implementations that provide the best performance for 60fps interactions. Fabric.js provides excellent web-based vector manipulation, Core Graphics offers precise iOS control, and Android Canvas with Compose gives modern UI integration.

**Alternatives considered**: 
- Cross-platform solutions like React Native or Flutter - rejected due to canvas performance limitations
- WebGL-based solutions - rejected due to complexity and mobile compatibility issues
- Single web-based PWA - rejected due to native app requirements and performance constraints

### 2. Device Simulation Accuracy

**Decision**: CSS/JavaScript-based device frames with accurate viewport dimensions using device-specific viewport meta tags and CSS transforms

**Rationale**: Provides pixel-perfect simulation of target devices with correct aspect ratios, safe areas, and responsive behavior. Allows real-time device switching without canvas state loss.

**Alternatives considered**:
- iOS Simulator embedding - rejected due to web platform limitations
- Physical device screenshots - rejected due to static nature and update complexity
- Generic mobile viewport - rejected due to accuracy requirements

### 3. Gesture-Based AI Navigation

**Decision**: Scroll event capture with velocity tracking and momentum simulation to mimic social media feed behavior

**Rationale**: Users already understand social media scroll patterns. Velocity tracking allows natural gesture recognition, and momentum provides familiar physics-based interaction.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Swipe gestures only - rejected due to limited discoverability
- Button-based navigation - rejected due to non-visual interaction requirement
- Voice commands - rejected due to focus on visual collaboration

### 4. Branching History (DAG) Storage

**Decision**: Immutable state trees with copy-on-write semantics stored in platform-native databases with JSON serialization

**Rationale**: Ensures no data loss, enables efficient undo/redo, supports complex branching scenarios, and provides cross-platform compatibility through JSON serialization.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Git-like version control - rejected due to complexity and binary canvas data
- Linear history with branches - rejected due to tree navigation complexity
- Memory-only storage - rejected due to persistence requirements

### 5. AI Integration Architecture

**Decision**: Event-driven AI service with JSON schema validation, request queuing, and graceful fallback to local cache

**Rationale**: Provides reliable AI responses with schema validation, handles network interruptions gracefully, and maintains responsive user experience during AI processing.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Synchronous AI calls - rejected due to UX blocking behavior
- Polling-based updates - rejected due to inefficiency and battery impact
- WebSocket real-time - rejected due to complexity and mobile connection reliability

### 6. Cross-Platform State Synchronization

**Decision**: Abstract state management layer with platform-specific persistence adapters and conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) for future cloud sync

**Rationale**: Enables consistent behavior across platforms while preparing for future cloud synchronization requirements without requiring current implementation.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Platform-specific independent states - rejected due to user experience fragmentation
- Immediate cloud synchronization - rejected due to local-first constitutional requirement
- File-based state sharing - rejected due to platform limitations and security concerns

### 7. Performance Optimization Strategy

**Decision**: Virtual scrolling for history navigation, canvas viewport culling, and incremental AI processing with progressive enhancement

**Rationale**: Maintains 60fps performance with large numbers of design variations, reduces memory usage, and provides responsive user experience even with complex AI processing.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Load-all approach - rejected due to memory and performance constraints
- Aggressive caching only - rejected due to memory limitations on mobile devices
- Server-side rendering - rejected due to local-first requirements

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Web Platform
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript for type safety and component reusability
- **Canvas**: Fabric.js for vector object manipulation with performance optimizations
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit with RTK Query for async operations
- **Storage**: IndexedDB with Dexie.js for structured data and blob storage
- **Testing**: Playwright for UI testing, Jest for unit testing

### iOS Platform  
- **Framework**: SwiftUI for declarative UI with UIKit integration for canvas performance
- **Canvas**: Core Graphics with Metal integration for performance-critical operations
- **State Management**: Combine framework with ObservableObject pattern
- **Storage**: Core Data with CloudKit preparation layer
- **Testing**: XCUITest for UI automation, XCTest for unit testing

### Android Platform
- **Framework**: Jetpack Compose with custom Canvas components  
- **Canvas**: Android Canvas API with hardware acceleration
- **State Management**: ViewModel with StateFlow and coroutines
- **Storage**: Room database with cloud abstraction layer
- **Testing**: Espresso for UI testing, JUnit for unit testing

### Shared Components
- **AI Integration**: Gemini API with OpenAPI-generated clients
- **Schema Validation**: JSON Schema validation across all platforms
- **State Serialization**: Protocol Buffers for efficient cross-platform data exchange

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Phase 1**: Web platform with device simulation and basic canvas functionality
2. **Phase 2**: AI integration with gesture navigation and branching history
3. **Phase 3**: iOS native implementation with shared business logic
4. **Phase 4**: Android native implementation and cross-platform testing
5. **Phase 5**: Performance optimization and cloud abstraction layer preparation

## Risk Mitigation

- **Canvas Performance**: Early performance testing with large numbers of objects
- **AI Response Times**: Implement optimistic UI updates and caching strategies  
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Shared integration test suite for business logic
- **Memory Management**: Implement aggressive garbage collection and object pooling
- **Offline Functionality**: Comprehensive offline testing scenarios
