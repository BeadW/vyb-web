   - Add image layer: Sample photo
   - Add background: Gradient
   - Save as initial variation

2. **Generate AI Suggestions**:
   - Trigger AI analysis (manual or automatic)
   - Wait for 3 AI variations to be generated
   - Verify each suggestion has confidence scores

3. **Test Gesture Navigation**:
   - **Scroll Down**: Navigate to next AI suggestion
   - **Scroll Up**: Return to previous variation
   - **Rapid Scroll**: Test momentum and smooth transitions
   - **Edge Cases**: Scroll at beginning/end of history

### Expected Results
- Smooth 60fps scrolling animation between variations

- ✅ Smooth transitions between all variations
- ✅ Edge case handling (first/last variation)

## Test Scenario 3: Branching History Preservation

### Objective
Ensure all design iterations are preserved in DAG structure without data loss.

### Steps
1. **Create Linear History**:
   - Start with blank canvas (Root)
   - Make user edit: Add text → User Edit 1
   - Make another edit: Change color → User Edit 2
   - Generate AI suggestion → AI Suggestion 1

2. **Create Branching**:
   - Return to User Edit 1
   - Make different edit: Add image → User Edit 3  
   - Generate AI from this branch → AI Suggestion 2
   - Return to Root and create third branch → User Edit 4

3. **Navigate History Tree**:
   - Use gesture navigation to traverse branches
   - Verify all variations are accessible
   - Check no data loss in any branch
   - Test history visualization (if implemented)

### Expected Results
- All variations preserved in DAG structure
- No circular references in history tree
- Each branch maintains complete canvas state
- Navigation works across all branches

### Validation Criteria
- ✅ DAG structure maintains acyclic property
- ✅ All variations accessible through navigation
- ✅ Complete canvas state preserved in each node
- ✅ Memory usage remains stable with deep histories

## Test Scenario 4: Multi-Layer AI Collaboration

### Objective
Test AI's ability to modify individual layers while preserving overall design structure.

### Steps  
1. **Create Complex Design**:
   - Background layer: Solid color
   - Text layer 1: Headline text
   - Text layer 2: Body text
   - Image layer: Profile photo
   - Shape layer: Decorative element

2. **Request AI Modifications**:
   - Ask AI to improve typography only
   - Request color scheme enhancement
   - Ask for layout optimization
   - Request trend-based updates

3. **Validate Layer Independence**:
   - Verify AI modifies only relevant layers
   - Check layer order preservation
   - Ensure unrelated layers remain unchanged
   - Test layer group handling

### Expected Results
- AI modifies only specified layers or relevant ones
- Layer relationships and ordering preserved
- Original design structure maintained
- Changes are contextually appropriate

### Validation Criteria
- ✅ Layer-specific modifications work correctly
- ✅ Unrelated layers remain unchanged
