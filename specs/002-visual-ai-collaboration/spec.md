# Feature Specification: Visual AI Collaboration Canvas

**Feature Branch**: `002-visual-ai-collaboration`  
**Created**: 2025-09-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build an application that allows users to collaborate visually with AI for making social media posts. The method of collaboration is via the canvas where the user can make changes and then scroll like they would a social media feed to see ai suggeted versions. We will be adding many kinds of layers and other tools which the user and the AI will be able to use. It is crucial that the collabration canvas be contained in a simulated device (we will need to be able to change devices in the future and the devices should have the same aspect ratios etc as real ones). We will be having the Gemini agent make it's own changes based on trends, best practices and creative suggestions to delight the user. THIS IS NOT A CHAT INTERFACE collaboration happens visually and elegantly using gestures one would intuitively understand already."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A social media content creator wants to rapidly iterate on post designs with AI assistance. They create initial content on a canvas that simulates their target device (phone, tablet, etc.), then use intuitive scroll gestures - just like browsing a social media feed - to see AI-generated variations. The AI collaborates by suggesting improvements based on current trends, design best practices, and creative enhancements, allowing the creator to quickly explore multiple design directions without losing their original work.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a blank canvas in device simulation mode, **When** user adds text and images to create a post design, **Then** the design appears exactly as it would on the target device with correct aspect ratios and proportions
2. **Given** a completed initial design, **When** user scrolls down (like a social media feed), **Then** system displays AI-generated variations of their design based on trends and best practices
3. **Given** multiple AI suggestions are available, **When** user scrolls up/down between suggestions, **Then** they can navigate between different AI-generated versions while preserving their original design
4. **Given** user finds an AI suggestion they like, **When** they make manual edits to the AI version, **Then** system creates a new branch in the design history while preserving both the AI suggestion and user modifications
5. **Given** user is working with layers (text, images, backgrounds), **When** AI generates suggestions, **Then** AI can modify individual layers while respecting the overall design structure
6. **Given** user wants to preview for different devices, **When** they select a different device simulation, **Then** canvas maintains proper aspect ratios and proportions for the new device type

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user scrolls rapidly through multiple AI suggestions?
- How does system handle when AI service is temporarily unavailable?
- What occurs when user tries to make edits while AI is generating suggestions?
- How does system manage memory when many design variations exist?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a canvas contained within an accurate device simulation (phone, tablet) with correct aspect ratios matching real devices
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to add and manipulate multiple types of layers (text, images, backgrounds, shapes)
- **FR-003**: System MUST enable gesture-based navigation using scroll actions to browse AI suggestions, mimicking social media feed interaction patterns
- **FR-004**: System MUST integrate with Gemini AI to generate design variations based on current trends, best practices, and creative suggestions
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve all design variations in a branching history structure where no work is ever lost
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow switching between different device simulations while maintaining design integrity
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide visual collaboration without requiring text-based chat or command interfaces
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow users to manually edit AI-generated suggestions, creating new branches in the design history
- **FR-009**: System MUST support multiple layer types that both users and AI can manipulate independently
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide immediate visual feedback for all user interactions with smooth, responsive performance
- **FR-011**: System MUST work offline for user modifications while gracefully handling AI service interruptions

### Key Entities
- **Design Canvas**: The primary workspace containing all visual elements, constrained within device simulation boundaries
- **Device Simulation**: Virtual representation of target devices (phones, tablets) with accurate screen dimensions and aspect ratios
- **Layer**: Individual design elements (text, image, background, shape) that can be manipulated independently
- **Design Variation**: AI-generated or user-modified versions of the base design, stored in branching history
- **Gesture Navigation**: Scroll-based interaction system for browsing between design variations
- **AI Collaboration State**: Current status of AI processing, suggestions, and integration with user modifications
