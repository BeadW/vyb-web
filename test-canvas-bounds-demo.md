# Canvas Bounds Awareness Test

## Implementation Summary

We've successfully implemented canvas bounds awareness for the Gemini AI integration:

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Added Canvas Bounds Models**
   - `CanvasBounds` struct with width/height and helper methods
   - `contains(x:y:)` method to check if coordinates are within bounds
   - `center` property to get canvas center point

2. **Enhanced SimpleLayerData** 
   - `isVisible(within:)` method to check layer visibility
   - `visibilityDescription(within:)` method for AI context

3. **Updated AI Service Method Signatures**
   - `generateDesignVariations(for:canvasSize:)` now accepts canvas size
   - Canvas bounds are passed through the entire AI analysis pipeline

4. **Enhanced Gemini Prompts**
   - Clear explanation of visible canvas area (0,0) to (width,height)
   - Layer visibility status for each layer (visible/off-canvas with direction)
   - Explicit instructions about on-canvas vs off-canvas positioning

5. **Updated ContentView Integration**
   - Passes current `canvasSize` to AI service call
   - Canvas dimensions are dynamically calculated based on screen size

## Testing Scenarios

To test this implementation, we can:

1. **Create layers positioned off-canvas** (e.g., x=-50, y=-50)
2. **Trigger AI analysis** to see if Gemini recognizes these as off-canvas
3. **Verify Gemini's suggestions** prioritize bringing layers back on-canvas
4. **Check console logs** for visibility descriptions in AI prompts

## Expected Behavior

Now when Gemini analyzes the design, it will:
- See clear canvas bounds (e.g., "CANVAS BOUNDS: width: 390.0, height: 243.75")
- Know which layers are "visible on canvas" vs "off-canvas (direction)"
- Make conscious decisions about positioning layers within visible area
- Only place layers off-canvas if it's a deliberate design choice

## Example Prompt Enhancement

Before: 
```
Layer layer1: text 'Hello World' at (150.0, 100.0)
```

After:
```
CANVAS BOUNDS: width: 390.0, height: 243.75
- Visible area: (0, 0) to (390.0, 243.75)
- Canvas center: (195.0, 121.88)

CURRENT DESIGN LAYERS:
Layer layer1: text 'Hello World' at (150.0, 100.0) - visible on canvas
Layer layer2: text 'Off Screen' at (-50.0, -25.0) - off-canvas (top-left)
```

This gives Gemini complete context about the visible coordinate space and allows it to make informed positioning decisions.
